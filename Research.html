        <p>Keyboards and specialized macros are too expensive, therefore artists and creative professionals often have a difficult time purchasing the necessary equipment for their jobs. 
        They are still searching for a solution that balances their low income with a product that effectivey performs the desired functions. 
        In addition to this, portable keyboards present another unsolved problems. 
        Current solutions cut corners that result in a lower quality product.
        Some products are completely software, but they are bothersome when it comes to managing and operating the keys. 
        There have also been rubber roll up keyboards, but they lack the legitimacy of actual piano keys. 
        Our product, the ModU-Keyboard, addresses both of these problems by combining portable keyboards and specialized macros.

        <h2>Prior Solutions</h2>
        <p>A few prior solutions, as mentioned above, include macro keyboards and portable keyboards. 
        Current macros include a number of pretty cool features that include being entirely programmable and portable. 
        However, the main flaws lie in costs. 
        Good-quality macros are expensive, often ranging from $70-$150, making it difficult for those with low incomes. 
        As for portable keyboards, on the other hand, we havenâ€™t seen an amazing solution that solves the problem. 
        Online piano websites, for example, are often difficult to control considering the fact that musicians are accustomed to piano keys. 
        Roll up keyboards and their incompatibility are also a nuisance, making it difficult for artists to manage and effectively do their jobs.
