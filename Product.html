                        <h2>What is the ModU-Keyboard?</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Our solution is a creative combination of a piano keyboard placed on top of a computer keyboard. 
                    A row of computer keys are programmed to make piano sounds through a software. 
                    Keys can be individually programmed with various types of code to be used as any key found on a macro.
                    A few applicable coding websites include Virtual Midi Piano Keyboard, Auto Hot Key, or even Scratch.mit.edu for children.
                    The keyboard is designed to hit a certain computer key when a piano key is pressed down on. 
                    The computer key sound is set to the respective piano key.
                    This product includes 2 octaves of piano keys, 26 keys in total, as well as 16 white keys, 10 black keys, one connection piece, and two rods.

                        <h2>Why the ModU-Keyboard?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>So why is our product better than previous solutions? 
                        The ModU-Keyboard is a solution made out of plastic material that combines a piano and computer keyboard.
                        This makes it inexpensive, light, and easier to assemble. 
                        The product is additionally portable, allowing professionals to use it anywhere at any time.
                        While providing functionality and accessibility, the ModU-keyboard may provide learning opportunities to learn or improve computer programming skills.
                        With its easy operation, the keyboard is usable for people of all ages.
